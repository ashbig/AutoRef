<strong>Why isnâ€™t my institution a member of this network?</strong> 
<p>Member institutions have already agreed to the terms of our material transfer 
agreement (MTA), in advance of their researchers placing plasmid orders.  
This means that when researchers from member institutions order plasmids, 
we begin processing their order without the delay of negotiating the MTA.</p>  

<p>If you are interested in your institution joining our network so that 
you can also receive your plasmids without delay, please contact us at 
<a href="mailto:plasmidMTA@hms.harvard.edu">plasmidMTA@hms.harvard.edu</a>.</p>

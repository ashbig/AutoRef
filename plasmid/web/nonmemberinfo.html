<strong>Why isn&#8217;t my institution a member of this network?</strong> 
<p>Member institutions have already agreed to the terms of our material transfer 
  agreement (MTA), in advance of their researchers placing plasmid orders. This 
  means that when researchers from member institutions order plasmids, we begin 
  processing their order without the delay of negotiating the MTA. </p>
<p>If you are interested in your institution joining our network so that you can 
  also receive your plasmids without delay, please contact us at plasmidMTA@hms.harvard.edu.<br>

  <p class="homepageText3">Answers to Frequently Asked Questions </p>
  <p class="homepageLink"><em><strong>Sequencing is cheap insurance! </strong>We 
    recommend that you do diagnostic tests on all clones,<br>
    </em><em>including sequence verified clones. Feedback on your results is welcome.</em></p>
  <table width="75%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
    <tr>
      <td><p align="left"><strong><em>In what form will I receive the clones?</em></strong> 
          Within the U.S. clones are sent as glycerol stocks. For international 
          requests, we send DNA spotted to sterile filter paper (recover by adding 
          TE or asimilar buffer, followed by transformation). </p>
        <p align="left"><em><strong>Can I view info about the clones I requested 
          and check request status?</strong></em> You can always return to past 
          requests and check request status by signing in and going to &quot;my 
          accounts&quot; (top right of the page). Click on a specific clone order 
          then look for the link at the bottom (# of clones) that takes you to 
          a table of information lets you download an Excel spreadsheet with basic 
          information about the clones.</p>
        <p align="left"><em><strong>What's &quot;closed&quot; vs. &quot;fusion&quot; 
          format? </strong></em>This terminology, adopted from the Harvard Institute 
          of Proteomics (HIP), indicates that a stop codon is present (closed) 
          or is absent (fusion) in a cDNA or ORF insert. Fusion format clones 
          are useful for producing C-terminally tagged versions of an ORF.</p>
        <p align="left"><em><strong>Can I use restriction enzymes with human clones 
          in pDNR-Dual?</strong></em> The human pDNR-Dual master clones from HIP 
          were generated using the InFusion reaction (Clontech) rather than an 
          RE approach and most of the RE sites in the MCS are gone after the insert 
          is introduced. In the resulting master clones, the <em>Hind</em>III 
          and <em>Sal</em>I sites are present so that enzyme pair can be used 
          to liberate the insert -- but beware! There could be <em>Hind</em>III 
          or <em>Sal</em>I sites in the insert. See more on the flexibility of 
          using the recombinational cloning approach rather than REs below.</p>
        <p align="left"><em><strong>I cannot find the clone I am interested in. 
          How can I find it? </strong></em></p>
        <p align="left">(A) ARE YOU SIGNED IN? Before sign-in, only the clones 
          available to all users are visible in a search. Register and sign in 
          to view all the clones you are eligible to view and request. Also, there 
          is also a necessary delay between when clones are shared with us and 
          when they are available via the database. If you've been refered by 
          a researcher who shared clones with the repository and can't find the 
          clone, please contact Stephanie Mohr.</p>
        <p align="left">(B) DID YOU USE RECOGNIZED TERMS? Please use 'official' 
          identifiers from the NCBI Entrez Gene database or from organism-specific 
          databases. We suggest you try your search more than one way to be sure 
          you're seeing everything (by gene symbol and by GenBank ID, for example). 
          In addition, we continue to work on new search types and welcome your 
          feedback on searches. If you have searched carefully and still cannot 
          find a clone that you are fairly certain should be in the collection, 
          please contact Stephanie Mohr.</p>
        <p align="left">(C) TRY OTHER SOURCES. There are many other sources for 
          plasmids. Our <a href="http://dnaseq.med.harvard.edu/plasmid-related_links.htm" title="DF HCC DNA Resource Core Plasmid Links Page" target="_blank">Plasmid 
          Links Page</a> is one place to start to look for other sources.</p>
        <p align="left"> <em><strong>Will I have to get a Materials Transfer Agreement 
          (MTA) signed in order to receive clones?</strong></em> It depends. </p>
        <p align="left">ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS: FLEXGene clones from HIP are covered 
          by a minimally restrictive MTA sent with clones. Most other clones are 
          covered by our standard MTA, which has been pre-approved by some institutions 
          and is based on the well-recognized Uniform Biologicals MTA (UB-MTA). 
          For some clones and for some institutions, however, you will have to 
          get a signed MTA to us before we can send the clones. In a few exceptional 
          cases, you will have to get a third-party MTA signed before we can send 
          the clone, as all or part of the clone is covered by MTAs from more 
          than one institution. For more information about MTAs, including information 
          about how to join our 'in network' group with pre-approved MTA coverage, 
          please contact Stephanie Mohr. If you request clones and an MTA is required, 
          the MTA will be emailed to you as a PDF file.</p>
        <p align="left">COMPANIES: Most of the HIP FLEXGene clones are available 
          to companies and will be covered by a minimally restrictive MTA between 
          HIP and your company. We will email the MTA after you place a request. 
          You are also welcome to get in touch to review the terms before placing 
          your request.</p>
        <p align="left"><em><strong>What is the difference between a &quot;discrepancy&quot; 
          and a &quot;mutation&quot;? </strong></em></p>
        <p align="left">'Discrepancy' is a term borrowed from HIP that refers 
          to differences between the actual clone sequence and the target sequence 
          (that is, what the researchers were trying to clone in a specific cloning 
          effort). Discrepancies can result when the clone recovered is an isoform 
          or naturally occuring polymorphic form of the target sequence, or from 
          PCR, replication, or other errors. Be sure to check the insert sequence 
          to be sure that discrepancies that were deemed 'acceptable' to HIP researchers 
          are also acceptable to you. </p>
        <p align="left">'Mutations' we define as changes that are known or expected 
          to affect function. We curate an insert as containing a mutation when 
          the insert sequence is a known mutant form (e.g. cloned from a mutant 
          allele) or when the clone was engineered to have a mutation (e.g. in 
          a site-specific mutagenesis effort). Please be aware that there may 
          OR MAY NOT be experimental evidence to support the idea that a particular 
          naturally occurring or engineered mutation results in a constitutively 
          active, inactive, etc. form. And be further cautioned ... neither 'discrepancy' 
          nor 'mutation' is the last word on nucleotide differences between your 
          actual clone and the wild-type form(s). Tags can come from vectors and 
          not be annotated as part of the insert; mutations and deletions may 
          not be clearly annotated or detected by those who shared clones; and 
          recombination or replication errors can change clones over time. DNA 
          sequencing provides an inexpensive and robust means to ask if the clone 
          you received is indeed the clone you requested and that it meets your 
          expectations. Please perform diagnostic tests before investing a lot 
          of time in your experiments!</p>
        <p align="left"><em><strong>What's with recombinational cloning (pDNR-Dual, 
          pDONR201, pDONR221, etc. vectors)?</strong></em> Most clones generated 
          at HIP and shared with the repository are based on successful recombinational 
          cloning methologies such as the Clontech Creator system (LoxP sites) 
          or the Invitrogen Gateway system (att sties). You can learn more about 
          these approaches at vendors' websites and at the HIP website http://www.hip.harvard.edu 
          (look for inforamtion about FLEXGene clones). These flexible systems 
          allow a single sequence-verified ORF (&quot;master&quot; or &quot;donor&quot; 
          clone) to be used to create expression constructs for a variety of different 
          techniques via recombination (few steps) rather than restriction enzyme 
          cloning and ligation (several steps). In general, we keep the master 
          clones in our collection because they give the most flexibility to the 
          largest set of users. But in some cases, we also have expression versions. 
          &quot;Entry&quot; or &quot;acceptor&quot; vectors used in combination 
          with master clones to create expression constructs are available from 
          a number of different sources, including Clontech and Invitrogen. Please 
          visit their websites to learn more.</p>
        <p align="left"><em><strong>Do HIP cDNA/ORF clones have 5' or 3' UTRs?</strong></em> 
          No. The majority of HIP clone collections (including human, yeast, and 
          more) come from projects in which only the open reading frames (ORFs) 
          were cloned.</p>
        <p align="left"><em><strong>Can I get help identifying a large sub-group 
          of clones bioinformatically?</strong></em> Yes. Bioinformaticists at 
          our host institution, HIP, may be willing to collaborate with you to 
          identify specific sub-groups of clones that share some property (biochemical 
          function, sub-cellular localization, up-regulated in a tissue tested 
          by microarray, etc.). Please contact Stephanie Mohr to initiate this 
          kind of collaborative bioinformatics-based work with bioinformaticists 
          at HIP. Requests are reviewed and accepted on a case-by-case basis. 
          Please note that we make some bioinformatically organized groups of 
          clones available for view and request on the &quot;clone collections&quot; 
          page (for example, human kinase collections and the BC1000 genes associated 
          with breast cancer). </p>
        <p align="left"><em><strong>Who should I cite if my work with a clone 
          requested via PlasmID results in publication? </strong></em>The people 
          who put in the hard work to make the clone and any appropriate references 
          should be cited! You should be able to find this information on the 
          clone detail page (click on the CloneID to get there). Look for clone 
          authors and PubMed IDs (vectors can also have associated authors and 
          PubMed IDs).</p>
        <p align="left"><em><strong>Why am I charged for clones?</strong></em> 
          There are very real costs associated with storage, maintenance and distribution 
          of clones that we simply must pass along to those who request clones 
          in order to ensure long-term stability of the repository and to adhere 
          to the requirements of our granting agencies. Grants and institutional 
          support help us to off-set costs and we make every effort to keep costs 
          at a minimum through efficiency and other cost management strategies. 
          Please note that there is no charge to store clones with the repository, 
          and no charge to you when another group requests clones you shared with 
          the repository. If you frequently send clones in response to requests 
          from outside researchers, please consider passing that burden along 
          to us.</p>

      <td class="tableinfo">Q: What are &quot;FUSION&quot; and &quot;CLOSED&quot; 
        forms of a cDNA?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText">A: &quot;FUSION&quot; and &quot;CLOSED&quot; are 
        terms used by the <a href="http://www.hip.harvard.edu">Harvard Institute 
        of Proteomics</a> that were adopted by the core. The &quot;FUSION&quot; 
        cDNA open reading frames lack the natural stop codon at the three-prime 
        end of the gene (the ORF is ATG to last amino acid-coding codon), in order 
        to facilitate construction of a C-terminal fusion protein. In contrast, 
        &quot;CLOSED&quot; cDNA ORFs have the natural stop codon of the gene (the 
        ORF is ATG to STOP).</td>

      <td class="tableinfo">Q: What is the difference between a &quot;MUTATION&quot; 
        and a&quot;DISCREPANCY&quot;?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText">A: The &quot;MUTATION&quot; column indicates the 
        presence of a purposefully engineered mutation or the presence of a mutation 
        that is present because the fragment was cloned from a known mutant form 
        of a gene. Please note that C-terminal and N-terminal fusions are not 
        listed as &quot;mutations&quot; and you should look closely at the insert 
        and vector information to determine if a fusion protein is encoded in 
        the plasmid. The &quot;DISCREPANCY&quot; designation was adopted from 
        its use with the Harvard Institute of Proteomics cDNA ORF collection. 
        These report nucleotide differences between the reference sequence the 
        researchers were trying to clone and the actual sequence of the clone. 
        The discrepancies could be the result of cloning an isoform or polymorphic 
        version of the target sequence, or the result of PCR/similar errors in 
        the cloning process. Discrepancies usually cause only silent or conservative 
        changes; however, you should perform a conceptual translation of the actual 
        sequence provided in order to check if the cDNA ORF is appropriate for 
        your experiments.</td>

      <td class="tableinfo">Q: I found a cDNA I am interested in but it's in a 
        recombinational cloning &quot;master&quot; or &quot;donor&quot; vector. 
        Do you have the cDNA in an expression vector?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText">A: We make every effort to keep the database up-to-date, 
        so if you did not find a cDNA in a specific expression vector then we 
        probably do not currently have it in our collection. By storing the master 
        vectors, we hope to give the most flexibility to the most labs, who will 
        no doubt be interested in expression vectors specific to their experiments. 
        More information about recombinational cloning can be found at vendor 
        websites, and expression vectors are available from vendors and from other 
        labs. As is always true, you are welcome to contact the lab that created 
        the clones to see if they are willing to share, create, or collaborate 
        on transfer of a set of genes from a master vector to a specific expression 
        vector.</td>

      <td class="tableinfo">Q: In what form will I receive the clones I order?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText">A: Clones are usually sent as glycerol stocks. 
        You can find what host strain is used by clicking to see the clone information 
        from the results table (or from your order table), where you can also 
        find growth conditions for the clone. In order to standardize and reduce 
        costs for shipping, our standard practice is to send clones on foil-sealed 
        96-well plates.</td>

    <tr valign="top"> 
      <td class="tableinfo">Q: How do you handle Materials Transfer Agreements 
        (MTAs)?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText">A: We make every effort to streamline the MTA process. 
        We have a special arrangement with some institutions that allows us to 
        send most clones to their researchers without a separate MTA being filled 
        out for each transaction. For researchers at other institutions, we will 
        ask that you send a signed copy of our standard MTA, which is based on 
        but not identical to the Universal Biologicals MTA, before we send clones. 
        For some plasmids, additional MTAs will have to be signed or filed with 
        other institutions before we can send the clones.</td>

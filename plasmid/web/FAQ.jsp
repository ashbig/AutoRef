          The plasmid repository was established in 2004 at    the Harvard Institute of Proteomics (HIP) at Harvard Medical     School.&nbsp; Our    repository holds collections of sequenced-verified open reading frame (ORF)    clones made by HIP researchers, and various clones from other researchers    throughout the region.&nbsp; <br />
          <br />
        We accept deposits of both large and small clone    collections from researchers and distribute their clones to universities    across the world. See our<a href="http://psimr.asu.edu/depositingslides.html" target="_blank"> slide show</a> for an overview of the repository and how to deposit plasmids.<br />

          <br />
          <strong>Q. <a name="registration1" id="registration1"></a>Do I have to register?</strong> <br />
          A. You do not have to register to search the    database, download vector and clone maps, or view other information. However,    you do have to register and sign in before placing an order. Registration is    live so you will be able to sign in as soon as you have completed on-line    registration.&nbsp; We recommend signing in before you start searching for    plasmids because not all plasmids are visible before registration and it    saves a few steps later if you plan on ordering plasmids.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Q.<a name="registration2" id="registration2"></a>&nbsp;My PI is not on the    registration list.&nbsp; How do I register?</strong> <br />
          A. You will need to fill out information for both    yourself and the PI during registration.&nbsp;People from the same lab will    be able to find their PI on the list the next time someone registers.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Q.<a name="registration3" id="registration3"></a>&nbsp;I am the PI in addition to    being the ?user? who will place orders.&nbsp; How do I register?</strong> <br />
        A. Please enter your information in both the user    and PI fields during registration. <br />
        <br />
        <a name="search" id="search"></a><strong class="formlabelitalic">PlasmID Search &amp; Order</strong> <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Q.&nbsp; <a name="search1" id="search1"></a>How do I search for    plasmids?</strong><br />
        There are many ways to search for plasmids on    PlasmID.&nbsp; You can search by specific terms, such as vector, insert name,    CloneID, depositor, TargetDB ID, PDB ID, protein expression, solubility or    purification. <a href="OrderOverview.jsp">Click here</a> for all our search options.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Q.<a name="search2" id="search2"></a> I did not find a plasmid of    interest in your collection.&nbsp; Am I searching correctly?</strong> <br />
        A. The most flexible search tool at PlasmID is the    Advanced Text Search tool. There, you can use gene names and synonyms, author    names, the part or full name of a vector, species name, PDB ID,    TargetDB/PepcDB ID or combinations to search plasmids. It is also helpful to    use ?official? gene names and identifiers as they appear in databases such as    NCBI Entrez Gene or organism-specific databases like SGD or FlyBase. Try    ?view empty vectors? to see a list of vectors that take inserts, act as    helper vectors, etc. You can enter more than one ID in a field at ?search by    gene? to search multiple genes at one time.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Q.<a name="search3" id="search3"></a> How do I place a request for    plasmids I identified on PlasmID?</strong> <br />
        A. Once you identify a plasmid of interest (in a    search results table or on a static list, for example), click the button at    the far right-hand side of the page to add it to your shopping cart.&nbsp;    When you are ready to check out, click the shopping cart icon (top right of    any page) to initiate check-out and follow the steps, being sure to click the    button at the bottom until your request is confirmed. <a href="OrderOverview.jsp">Click here</a> for more details about how to order. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Q. <a name="search4" id="search4"></a>How do I know if my request went    through or when I will receive the plasmid?</strong> <br />
        A. After you place a request, our system will send    a confirmation email.&nbsp; You can sign in at any time to view the status of    your request.&nbsp; In addition, you will receive an email when the plasmid    is shipped, including FedEx tracking information.&nbsp; Requests are filled    in the order in which they are received.&nbsp; Changes day-to-day in the    volume and size of requests makes it difficult to tell you the exact day the    plasmid(s) will ship, so please check in with the PlasmID system for updates. <br />
        <br />
        <strong><em>Q. </em><a name="search5" id="search5"></a>Can I view info about the clones I requested and    check request status?</strong> <br />
        A. You can always return to past requests and check    request status by signing in and going to &quot;my accounts&quot; (top right    of the page). Click on a specific clone order then look for the link at the    bottom (# of clones) that takes you to a table of information lets you download    an Excel spreadsheet with basic information about the clones.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Q. <a name="search6" id="search6"></a>How much do plasmids cost?</strong> <br />
        A. Please see current pricing on <a href="OrderOverview.jsp">this page</a>.</p>
        <p class="mainbodytext"><strong>Q.<a name="search7" id="search7"></a> How much does shipping cost?</strong> <br />
          A. There are three ways to pay for shipping: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="mainbodytext">Provide us with you    FedEx number. </li>
            <li class="mainbodytext">Flat shipping rate of    $10 for domestic orders and $20 for international orders. </li>
            <li class="mainbodytext">No charge for shipping    for the Harvard     Medical School    community. Pick up your order in the Seeley G.     Mudd Building    in the <a href="http://www.hip.harvard.edu/Location.html#Quad" target="_blank">HMS    Quad</a> in the second floor hallway freezer. You MUST have access to the    building to take advantage of this offer. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mainbodytext"><strong>Q.<a name="search8" id="search8"></a> Why am I charged for a plasmid?</strong> <br />
  A.&nbsp; These nominal costs&nbsp;are designed to offset the handling fees    associated with preparing and sending plasmids. In keeping with the terms    outlined by our granting agencies, our aim is always to offset costs, never    to make a profit. In addition, we make an effort to significantly reduce the    per-clone costs for large collections in order to encourage high-throughput    studies.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Q.<a name="search9" id="search9"></a> How can I pay for these plasmids?</strong> <br />
          A.&nbsp; You can pay using either a credit card or a purchase order number.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Q.<a name="search10" id="search10"></a> Do I need a PayPal account    to pay by credit card?</strong> <br />
          A.&nbsp; No you DO NOT need a PayPal account to pay by credit card.&nbsp;    PayPal is only used to securely collect the credit card information.&nbsp; At    check out, use the option to ?pay without an account.?<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Q.<a name="search11" id="search11"></a> In what form will I receive the    plasmids?</strong> <br />
          A. We usually ship plasmids at room temperature (no ice) as freshly-prepared    bacterial glycerol stocks.&nbsp; Our years of experience have shown that    plasmids are stable in that format during shipment (streak out and/or freeze    at -80 upon arrival). We occasionally ship plasmids as purified DNA in water. </p>
        <p class="mainbodytext"><strong>Q. <a name="search12" id="search12"></a>Can    I pick up my plasmids from your facility?<br />
          </strong>A. Yes.    During the check out process you may select ?Pick-Up? from the shipping    options. Pick up orders will be placed in the hallway freezer in the second    floor hallway of the Seely Mudd building. You must have access to this    building to request pick up for your shipping option. <br />
          </p>
        <p class="mainbodytext"><strong>Q. <a name="search13" id="search13"></a>How    long will it take for me to receive my plasmids?</strong><br />
          A. We ask that you please allow 7-10 days from the time that all MTA?s are    processed to receive your clone, but many small orders ship much faster. At a    minimum filling your order will take three days, however, we fill orders    based on the order in which they were received. Also if you place a large    order it takes more time to pick the clones, and this can take up to 4 weeks.    PLEASE NOTE: We do not ship over the weekend to ensure that people are in    your laboratory to receive the order.<br />
          </p>
        <p class="mainbodytext"><strong>Q.&nbsp;<a name="search14" id="search14"></a>    Will I need to get a signature on an MTA?</strong> <br />
          A. For certain plasmids, yes you will need an MTA    signature. We will be sure to identify the correct MTA and send it to you    electronically to be signed by the appropriate official in your technology    transfer office.&nbsp; An original signed copy of the MTA should be returned    to the DF/HCC DNA Resource CORE at Harvard    Medical School,    240 Longwood Ave,    LHRRB, Boston, MA 02115.&nbsp; <br />
          More    specifically, if you are: <br />
          ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS: FLEXGene clones from HIP are    covered by a minimally restrictive MTA sent with clones. Most other clones    are covered by our standard MTA, which has been pre-approved by some    institutions and is based on the well-recognized Uniform Biologicals MTA    (UB-MTA). For some clones and for some institutions, however, you will have    to get a signed MTA to us before we can send the clones. In a few exceptional    cases, you will have to get a third-party MTA signed before we can send the    clone, as all or part of the clone is covered by MTAs from more than one    institution. For more information about MTAs, including information about how    to join our 'in network' group with pre-approved MTA coverage, please contact <a href="mailto:plasmidhelp@hms.harvard.edu">plasmidhelp@hms.harvard.edu</a>.    If you request clones and an MTA is required, the MTA will be emailed to you    as a PDF file.<br />
          <br />
          COMPANIES: Most of the HIP FLEXGene clones are    available to companies and will be covered by a minimally restrictive MTA    between HIP and your company. We will email the MTA after you place a    request. You are also welcome to get in touch to review the terms before    placing your request.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Q.<a name="search15" id="search15"></a> Can we make this MTA process    easier?</strong> <br />
          A. YES!!!&nbsp; We have developed an Expedited    Process MTA that your institution signs and allows all researchers at that    institution to receive all plasmids from our collection with only an    electronic signature.&nbsp; Please email us if you are interested in starting    this process with your institution.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://psimr.asu.edu/Depositor%20Agreement/DA.html">Click here</a> for    more information about MTAs </p>
        <p class="mainbodytext"><span class="formlabelitalic"><a name="deposit" id="deposit"></a>HOW TO DEPOSIT PLASMIDS</span><br />
          <br />
          <strong>Q. <a name="deposit1" id="deposit1"></a>&nbsp;How do I deposit my clones?</strong><br />
          <a href="Submission.jsp">Click here</a> or contact us at plasmidhelp@hms.harvard.edu for more information about    depositing clones in our collection.&nbsp; See our <a href="http://psimr.asu.edu/depositingslides.html" target="_blank">slide show</a> for an overview of the repository and the submission process. The three steps    to deposit clones are<br />
          <br />
          1.&nbsp; Have your institution sign the Depositors    Agreement.&nbsp; This agreement sets the terms by which the plasmid    repository will distribute your plasmids.&nbsp; Contact us to see if your    institution has already signed a depositor agreement.&nbsp; Otherwise we will    contact your technology transfer office to begin the process.&nbsp; <a href="http://psimr.asu.edu/Depositor%20Agreement/DA.html">Click here</a> for    more information about depositor agreements.<br />
          <br />
          2.&nbsp; Prepare the data describing the details    about your clones.&nbsp; Because we parse the data directly into our    database, we ask that the information you send us is in a particular    format.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have submission forms and templates that should guide    you in this process.&nbsp; <br />
          <br />
          3.&nbsp; Once we have entered your data into our    database, we can accept your plasmid samples.&nbsp; These can be sent on dry    ice either as DNA (10-15ul of at least 15ng/ul) or glycerol stocks.&nbsp; If you    send glycerol stocks the bacteria MUST BE T1/T5 phage resistant.&nbsp; Once    we receive your samples, we will make them available for purchase through    PlasmID<br />
          <br />

          <br />
          <strong>Q.<a name="deposit4" id="deposit4"></a> What types of plasmids cannot be    shared with the repository?</strong> <br />
          A. Four types of plasmids cannot be added to the    repository.&nbsp; <br />
          <br />
          1. Plasmids that require an unusual or specific    bacterial host strain cannot be added, as we require that all plasmids are    stored here in a phage-resistant DH5-alpha-like host strain, in order to    maintain the integrity of the collection as a whole. <br />
          <br />
          2. Plasmids that are identical to material that is    commercially available cannot be added to our collection.&nbsp; <br />
          <br />
          3. Plasmids that are hazardous or legally restricted    for distribution cannot be added to the repository. <br />
          <br />
          4. Plasmids that you do not have the right to    distribute (for example, plasmids you received from another researcher and/or    made by another person and/or protected by a patent, licensing agreement, etc.)    cannot be shared with us unless permission is also granted by any and all    relevant third parties. Sometimes this extends even to modified forms of a    plasmid.&nbsp; In general, you can share plasmids that you made or made    significant modifications, but you cannot share unmodified forms of something    you got from another researcher or a company.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Q.<a name="deposit5" id="deposit5"></a> How are plasmids stored and    handled after I share them?</strong> <br />
          A. When you share plasmids with the repository, we    transform them into a phage-resistant bacterial host strain, single colony    isolate, and create working and archival glycerol stocks. These are stored in    conventional -80 degree freezers (archival copies) or in the fully automated    BioBank freezer storage system, in which working samples are stored in    individually 2D barcode-labeled tubes for automated retrieval and array in    any format.&nbsp; Information about each clone is carefully curated by    PhD-level scientists and entered into the database.</p>
        <p class="mainbodytext"><a name="plasmidinfo" id="plasmidinfo"></a><strong class="formlabelitalic">INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PLASMIDS</strong><br />
          <br />
          <strong>Q.<a name="plasmidinfo1" id="plasmidinfo1"></a> What's &quot;closed&quot; vs.    &quot;fusion&quot; format?</strong> <br />
          A. This terminology, adopted from the Harvard Institute of Proteomics (HIP),    indicates that a stop codon is present (closed) or is absent (fusion) in a    cDNA or ORF insert. For more details about these definitions <a href="Definitions for annotating CDS sequences_v4.doc" target="_blank">click here</a>. Fusion format clones are useful for producing    C-terminally tagged versions of an ORF.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Q.<a name="plasmidinfo2" id="plasmidinfo2"></a> Can I use restriction enzymes with    human clones in pDNR-Dual?</strong> <br />
          A. The human pDNR-Dual master clones from HIP were generated using the    InFusion reaction (Clontech) rather than an RE approach and most of the RE    sites in the MCS are gone after the insert is introduced. In the resulting    master clones, the <em>Hind</em>III    and <em>Sal</em>I sites are present so    that enzyme pair can be used to liberate the insert -- but beware! There    could be <em>Hind</em>III or <em>Sal</em>I sites in the insert. See more on    the flexibility of using the recombinational cloning approach rather than REs    below.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Q.<a name="plasmidinfo3" id="plasmidinfo3"></a> What is the difference between a    &quot;discrepancy&quot; and a &quot;mutation&quot;? </strong><br />
          A. 'Discrepancy' is a term borrowed from HIP that refers to differences    between the actual clone sequence and the target sequence (that is, what the    researchers were trying to clone in a specific cloning effort). Discrepancies    can result when the clone recovered is an isoform or naturally occurring    polymorphic form of the target sequence, or from PCR, replication, or other    errors. Be sure to check the insert sequence to be sure that discrepancies    that were deemed 'acceptable' to HIP researchers are also acceptable to you. <br />
          'Mutations' we define as changes that are known or expected to affect    function. We curate an insert as containing a mutation when the insert    sequence is a known mutant form (e.g. cloned from a mutant allele) or when    the clone was engineered to have a mutation (e.g. in a site-specific    mutagenesis effort). Please be aware that there may OR MAY NOT be    experimental evidence to support the idea that a particular naturally    occurring or engineered mutation results in a constitutively active,    inactive, etc. form. And be further cautioned ... neither 'discrepancy' nor    'mutation' is the last word on nucleotide differences between your actual    clone and the wild-type form(s). Tags can come from vectors and not be    annotated as part of the insert; mutations and deletions may not be clearly    annotated or detected by those who shared clones; and recombination or    replication errors can change clones over time. DNA sequencing provides an    inexpensive and robust means to ask if the clone you received is indeed the    clone you requested and that it meets your expectations. Please perform    diagnostic tests before investing a lot of time in your experiments!<br />

          <strong>Q.<a name="plasmidinfo4" id="plasmidinfo4"></a> What's with recombinational    cloning (pDNR-Dual, pDONR201, pDONR221, etc. vectors)?</strong> <br />
          A. Most clones generated at HIP and shared with the repository are based on    successful recombinational cloning methodologies such as the Clontech Creator    system (LoxP sites) or the Invitrogen Gateway system (att sties). You can    learn more about these approaches at vendors' websites and at the HIP website    http://www.hip.harvard.edu (look for information about FLEXGene clones).    These flexible systems allow a single sequence-verified ORF    (&quot;master&quot; or &quot;donor&quot; clone) to be used to create expression    constructs for a variety of different techniques via recombination (few    steps) rather than restriction enzyme cloning and ligation (several steps).    In general, we keep the master clones in our collection because they give the    most flexibility to the largest set of users. But in some cases, we also have    expression versions. &quot;Entry&quot; or &quot;acceptor&quot; vectors used    in combination with master clones to create expression constructs are    available from a number of different sources, including Clontech and    Invitrogen. Please visit their websites to learn more.<br />

          <strong>Q.<a name="plasmidinfo5" id="plasmidinfo5"></a> Do HIP cDNA/ORF clones have 5' or    3' UTRs?</strong> <br />
          A. No. The majority of HIP clone collections (including human, yeast, and    more) come from projects in which only the open reading frames (ORFs) were    cloned.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Q.<a name="plasmidinfo6" id="plasmidinfo6"></a> Can I get help identifying a large    sub-group of clones bioinformatically?</strong> <br />
          A. Yes. Bioinformaticists at our host institution, HIP, may be willing to    collaborate with you to identify specific sub-groups of clones that share    some property (biochemical function, sub-cellular localization, up-regulated    in a tissue tested by microarray, etc.). Please contact us to initiate this    kind of collaborative bioinformatics-based work with bioinformaticists at    HIP. Requests are reviewed and accepted on a case-by-case basis. Please note    that we make some bioinformatically organized groups of clones available for    view and request on the &quot;clone collections&quot; page (for example,    human kinase collections and the BC1000 genes associated with breast cancer). <br />

          <strong>Q. <a name="plasmidinfo7" id="plasmidinfo7"></a>Who should I cite if my work with    a clone requested via PlasmID results in publication?</strong><br />
          <strong>A. </strong>The people who put    in the hard work to make the clone and any appropriate references should be    cited! You should be able to find this information on the clone detail page    (click on the CloneID to get there). Look for clone authors and PubMed IDs    (vectors can also have associated authors and PubMed IDs).</p>

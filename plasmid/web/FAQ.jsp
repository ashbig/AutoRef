        Resource Core plasmid links page</a> to see a partial list of other sources.</td>

      <td class="tableinfo">Q: What are &quot;FUSION&quot; and &quot;CLOSED&quot; 
        forms of a cDNA?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText"><p>A: &quot;FUSION&quot; and &quot;CLOSED&quot; 
          are terms used by the <a href="http://www.hip.harvard.edu">Harvard Institute 
          of Proteomics</a> that were adopted by the core. The &quot;FUSION&quot; 
          cDNA open reading frames lack the natural stop codon at the three-prime 
          end of the gene (the ORF is ATG to last amino acid-coding codon), in 
          order to facilitate construction of a C-terminal fusion protein. In 
          contrast, &quot;CLOSED&quot; cDNA ORFs have the natural stop codon of 
          the gene (the ORF is ATG to STOP).</p>

      <td class="tableinfo">Q: What is the difference between a &quot;MUTATION&quot; 
        and a&quot;DISCREPANCY&quot;?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText"><p>A: The &quot;MUTATION&quot; column is not the 
          final word on the nucleotide sequence of the clone! We use &quot;mutation&quot; 
          to indicate the presence of a purposefully engineered mutation (for 
          example, a change introduced with the aim of creating a dominant negative 
          or inactive form of a gene) or the presence of a mutation cloned from 
          a mutant allele of a gene. Please note that neither elimination of the 
          stop codon (&quot;fusion&quot; format) nor C- or N-terminal tags (such 
          as GST or Myc) are NOT listed as mutations. Furthermore, tags can be 
          part of the insert or of the vector. Look closely at the insert and 
          vector information to determine if a fusion protein is encoded in the 
          plasmid.</p>
        <p> The &quot;DISCREPANCY&quot; designation was adopted from its use with 
          the Harvard Institute of Proteomics cDNA ORF collection. These report 
          nucleotide differences between the reference sequence the researchers 
          were trying to clone and the actual sequence of the clone. The discrepancies 
          could be the result of cloning an isoform or polymorphic version of 
          the target sequence, or the result of errors introduced during the cloning 
          process. Discrepancies usually cause only silent or conservative changes; 
          however, you should perform a conceptual translation of the actual sequence 
          provided in order to check if the cDNA ORF is appropriate for your experiments.</p>

      <td class="tableinfo">Q: I found a cDNA I am interested in but it's in a 
        recombinational cloning &quot;master&quot; or &quot;donor&quot; vector. 
        Do you have the cDNA in an expression vector?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText"><p>A: We make every effort to keep the database 
          up-to-date, so if you did not find a cDNA in a specific expression vector 
          then we probably do not currently have it in our collection. By storing 
          the master vectors, we hope to give the most flexibility to the most 
          labs, who will no doubt be interested in expression vectors specific 
          to their experiments. </p>
        <p>More information about recombinational cloning can be found at website 
          for vendors, such as Invitrogen and Clontech. In addition expression 
          vectors are available from vendors and from labs. As is always true, 
          you are welcome to contact the lab that created the clones to see if 
          they are willing to share, create, or collaborate on transfer of a set 
          of genes from a master vector to a specific expression vector.</td>

      <td class="tableinfo">Q: In what form will I receive the clones I order?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText">A: Clones are usually sent as glycerol stocks. 
        You can find out what host strain was used by clicking to see the clone 
        information from the results table (or from your order table), where you 
        can also find growth conditions for the clone. In order to standardize 
        and reduce costs for shipping, our standard practice is to send clones 
        on foil-sealed 96-well plates.</td>

    <tr valign="top"> 
      <td class="tableinfo">Q: Do HIP clones have 5' or 3'UTR sequences?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText"><p>A: No (for most cases). The Harvard Institute 
          of Proteomics (HIP) collections for human, yeast, Pseudomonas, and others 
          come from projects in which only the open reading frame (ORF) or a gene 
          or predicted gene was cloned. For human clones, cDNA was the template 
          but there is neither 5'UTR nor 3'UTR present. Similarly, UTRs are not 
          present in HIP's yeast or Pseudomonas ORF clones. This gives researchers 
          the ability to build N-terminal fusions from any &quot;closed&quot; 
          format clones, and to build N- or C-terminal fusions from any &quot;fusion&quot; 
          format clones.</p>
        <p> In contrast, cDNA clones from other laboratories may include (but 
          do not necessarily include) UTRs. Please visit the <a href="http://dnaseq.harvard.edu/plasmid-related_links.htm">DNA 
          Resource Core plasmid links page</a> to find additional sources for 
          plasmid clones, including full-length cDNAs, if you haven't been able 
          to find a clone in our collection.</p></td>

    <tr valign="top"> 
      <td class="tableinfo">Q: How do you handle Materials Transfer Agreements 
        (MTAs)?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText"><p>A: We make every effort to streamline the MTA 
          process. We have a special arrangement with some institutions that allows 
          us to send most clones to their researchers without a separate MTA being 
          filled out for each transaction. For researchers at other institutions, 
          we will ask that you send a signed copy of our standard MTA, which is 
          based on but not identical to the Universal Biologicals MTA, before 
          we send clones. </p>
        <p>For some plasmids, additional MTAs will have to be signed or filed 
          with other institutions before we can send the clones.</p></td>

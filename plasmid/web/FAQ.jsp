        all users are visible in a search. Only by registering and logging in 
        will you be able to view the complete set of clones that you are eligible 
        to view and order.</td>

      <td height="151" class="tableinfo">Q: I was directed to the site by a researcher 
        who donated clones to the repository. But I cannot find the plasmid I'm 
        looking for. What's up with that?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText"><p>A: There is a necessary delay between when plasmids 
          are submitted to the repository and when they are searchable in the 
          database. In addition, some plasmids may not be easy to find with the 
          set of search parameters available at a given time (we are always working 
          to improve this based on user feedback). </p>
        <p>As of summer 2005, the group of plasmids that are in the collection 
          but cannot be found with the currently supported searches includes the 
          'vector-only' plasmids pGRFP, pKT146, pKT176 and pKT178. </p>
        <p>If you have searched carefully for a plasmid that you think is in the 
          collection and you cannot find it, please contact <a href="http://dnaseq.med.harvard.edu/contact_us.htm" target="_blank">Stephanie

      <td class="homeMainText"><p>A: &quot;FUSION&quot; and &quot;CLOSED&quot; 
          are terms used by the <a href="http://www.hip.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Harvard Institute 
          of Proteomics</a> that were adopted by the core. The &quot;FUSION&quot; 
          cDNA open reading frames lack the natural stop codon at the three-prime 
          end of the gene (the ORF is ATG to last amino acid-coding codon), in 
          order to facilitate construction of a C-terminal fusion protein. In 
          contrast, &quot;CLOSED&quot; cDNA ORFs have the natural stop codon of 
          the gene (the ORF is ATG to STOP).</p>

      <td class="tableinfo">Q: What is the difference between a &quot;MUTATION&quot; 
        and a&quot;DISCREPANCY&quot;?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText"><p>A: The &quot;MUTATION&quot; column is not the 
          final word on the nucleotide sequence of the clone! We use &quot;mutation&quot; 
          to indicate the presence of a purposefully engineered mutation (for 
          example, a change introduced with the aim of creating a dominant negative 
          or inactive form of a gene) or the presence of a fragment cloned from 
          a mutant allele of a gene. Please note that elimination of the stop 
          codon (&quot;fusion&quot; format) and C- or N-terminal tags (such as 
          GST or Myc) and discrepancies that passed scientific criteria for an 
          'accepted' clone (see below) ARE NOT LISTED AS MUTATIONS. Furthermore, 
          tags can be part of the insert or of the vector. Look closely at the 
          insert and vector information to determine if a fusion protein is encoded 
          in the plasmid.</p>
        <p> The &quot;DISCREPANCY&quot; designation was adopted from its use with 
          the Harvard Institute of Proteomics cDNA ORF collection. These report 
          nucleotide differences between the reference sequence the researchers 
          were trying to clone and the actual sequence of the clone. The discrepancies 
          could be the result of cloning an isoform or polymorphic version of 
          the target sequence, or the result of errors introduced during the cloning 
          process. Discrepancies usually cause only silent or conservative changes 
          and the discrepancies present passed some set of criteria (different 
          for different clone sets) that would have eliminated 'big' changes relative 
          to the reference sequence. You should perform a conceptual translation 
          of the actual sequence provided in order to check if the cDNA ORF is 
          appropriate for your experiments.</p>

      <td class="tableinfo"><p>Q: I found a cDNA I am interested in but it's in 
          a RECOMBINATIONAL CLONING &quot;MASTER&quot; or &quot;DONOR&quot; vector. 
        </p>
        <p>What does this mean? </p>
        <p>And, do you have the cDNA in an expression vector?</p></td>
      <td class="homeMainText"><p>A: Recombinational cloning vectors use site-directed 
          DNA recombination strategies rather than restriction enzyme-based strategies 
          for capturing inserts and moving inserts from one vector to another. 
          In many cases, a gene insert is first placed in a &quot;master&quot; 
          or &quot;donor&quot; vector and can then be moved into a number of different 
          expression vectors, depending on your experimental needs, using the 
          appropriate recombinational cloning strategy. </p>
        <p>For clones in pDNR-Dual, most of the MCS is removed when the insert 
          is introduced. Inserts in pDNR-Dual can be liberated with a Sal I, Hind 
          III digest -- but beware that the insert could have Sal I and/or Hind 
          III sites, so you'll want to check the sequence first if you're using 
          a restriction digest strategy.</p>
        <p>We store master vectors in order to give the most flexibility to the 
          most labs, since researchers will no doubt be interested in using expression 
          vectors specific to their experiments. We make every effort to keep 
          the database up-to-date, so if you did not find a cDNA in a specific 
          expression vector then we probably do not currently have it in our collection.</p>
        <p>More information about recombinational cloning can be found at website 
          for vendors, such as Invitrogen and Clontech. In addition expression 
          vectors are available from vendors and from labs. As is always true, 
          you are welcome to contact the lab that created the clones to see if 
          they are willing to share, create, or collaborate on transfer of a set 
          of genes from a master vector to a specific expression vector.</td>

    <tr valign="top"> 
      <td class="tableinfo">Q: In what form will I receive the clones I order?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText"><p>A: Clones are usually sent as glycerol stocks. 
          You can find out what host strain was used by clicking the clone ID 
          from the search results table (or from your order summary table). There, 
          you can also find growth conditions for other host strains (for example, 
          for yeast shuttle plasmids, the growth conditions in yeast, if supplied 
          to us, are also presented). </p>
        <p>Standardization reduces costs for handling and shipping. Our standard 
          practice is to send clones as glycerol stocks in foil-sealed 96-well 
          plates.</p></td>

      <td class="tableinfo">Q: Do HIP cDNA/ORF clones have 5' or 3'UTR sequences?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText"><p>A: No (for most cases). The Harvard Institute 
          of Proteomics (HIP) collections for human, yeast, Pseudomonas, and others 
          come from projects in which only the open reading frame (ORF) or a gene 
          or predicted gene was cloned. For human clones, cDNA was the template 
          but there is neither 5'UTR nor 3'UTR present. Similarly, UTRs are not 
          present in HIP's yeast or Pseudomonas ORF clones. This gives researchers 
          the ability to build N-terminal fusions from any &quot;closed&quot; 
          format clones, and to build N- or C-terminal fusions from any &quot;fusion&quot; 
          format clones. In contrast, cDNA clones from other laboratories may 
          include (but do not necessarily include) UTRs. </p>

          Resource Core plasmid links page</a> to find additional sources for

      <td class="tableinfo">Q: How do you handle Materials Transfer Agreements 
        (MTAs)?</td>
      <td class="homeMainText"><p>A: We make every effort to streamline the MTA 
          process. We have a special arrangement with some institutions that allows 
          us to send most clones to their researchers without a separate MTA being 
          filled out for each transaction. For researchers at other institutions, 
          we will ask that you send a signed copy of our standard MTA, which is 
          based on but not identical to the Universal Biologicals MTA, before 
          we send clones. </p>
        <p>For some plasmids, additional MTAs will have to be signed and returned 
          to us and/or filed with other institutions before we can send the clones.</p></td>

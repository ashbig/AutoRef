                <span class="mainbodytext"><br>
                <strong>Q. Do I have to  register?</strong> <br>
                A. You do not have to register  to search the database, download vector and clone maps, or view other  information. However, you do have to register and sign in before placing a  request. Registration is live so you will be able to sign in as soon as you  have completed on-line registration.&nbsp; We recommend signing in before you  start searching for plasmids because not all plasmids are visible before registration and it saves a few steps later if you plan on ordering plasmids.<br><br>
                <strong>Q.&nbsp;My PI is not on  the registration list.&nbsp; How do I register?</strong> <br>
                A. You will need to fill out  information for both yourself and the PI during registration.&nbsp;People from  the same lab will be able to find their PI on the list the next time someone  registers.<br><br>
                <strong>Q.&nbsp;I am the PI in  addition to being the &ldquo;user&rdquo; who will place orders.&nbsp; How do I register?</strong> <br>
          A. Please enter your information  in both the user and PI fields during registration. <br>

          <strong><a name="searchorder"></a>PlasmID Search & Order</strong> </span><br><br>
          
          <strong>Q.&nbsp; How do I search for plasmids?</strong><br>
          There are many ways to search for plasmids  on PlasmID.&nbsp; You can search by specific  terms, such as vector, insert name, CloneID, depositor, TargetDB ID, PDB ID,  protein expression, solubility or purification. <a href="OrderOverview.jsp">Click here</a> for all our search options.<br><br>
          <strong>Q. I did not find a  plasmid of interest in your collection.&nbsp; Am I searching correctly?</strong> <br>
          A. The most flexible search tool  at PlasmID is the Advanced Text Search tool. There, you can use gene names and  synonyms, author names, the part or full name of a vector, species name, PDB  ID, TargetDB/PepcDB ID or combinations to search plasmids. It is also helpful  to use &ldquo;official&rdquo; gene names and identifiers as they appear in databases such  as NCBI Entrez Gene or organism-specific databases like SGD or FlyBase. Try  &ldquo;view empty vectors&rdquo; to see a list of vectors that take inserts, act as helper  vectors, etc. You can enter more than one ID in a field at &ldquo;search by gene&rdquo; to  search multiple genes at one time.<br><br>
          <strong>Q. How do I place a  request for plasmids I identified on PlasmID?</strong> <br>
          A. Once you identify a plasmid  of interest (in a search results table or on a static list, for example), click  the button at the far right-hand side of the page to add it to your shopping  cart.&nbsp; When you are ready to check out, click the shopping cart icon (top  right of any page) to initiate check-out and follow the steps, being sure to  click the button at the bottom until your request is confirmed. <a href="OrderOverview.jsp">Click  here</a> for more details about how to order. <br><br>
          <strong>Q. How do I know if my  request went through or when I will receive the plasmid?</strong> <br>
          A. After you place a request,  our system will send a confirmation email.&nbsp; You can sign in at any time to  view the status of your request.&nbsp; In addition, you will receive an email  when the plasmid is shipped, including FedEx tracking information.&nbsp;  Requests are filled in the order in which they are received.&nbsp; Changes  day-to-day in the volume and size of requests makes it difficult to tell you  the exact day the plasmid(s) will ship, so please check in with the PlasmID  system for updates. <br><br>
          <em><strong>Q. </strong></em><strong>Can I view  info about the clones I requested and check request status?</strong> <br>
          A. You can always return to past  requests and check request status by signing in and going to &quot;my  accounts&quot; (top right of the page). Click on a specific clone order then  look for the link at the bottom (# of clones) that takes you to a table of  information lets you download an Excel spreadsheet with basic information about  the clones.<br><br>
          <strong>Q. How much do plasmids  cost?</strong> <br>
          A. Please see current pricing on <a href="OrderOverview.jsp">this page</a>.<br><br>
          <strong>Q. Why am I charged for  a plasmid?</strong> <br>
          A.&nbsp; These nominal  costs&nbsp;are designed to offset the handling fees associated with preparing  and sending plasmids. In keeping with the terms outlined by our granting  agencies, our aim is always to offset costs, never to make a profit. In  addition, we make an effort to significantly reduce the per-clone costs for  large collections in order to encourage high-throughput studies.<br><br>
          <strong>Q. How can I pay for  these plasmids?</strong> <br>
          A.&nbsp; You can pay using  either a credit card or a purchase order number.<br><br>
          <strong>Q.&nbsp; Do I need a PayPal  account to pay by credit card?</strong> <br>
          A.&nbsp; No you DO NOT need a PayPal account to pay by  credit card.&nbsp; PayPal is only used to  securely collect the credit card information.&nbsp;  At check out, use the option to &ldquo;pay without an account.&rdquo;<br><br>
          <strong>Q. In what form will I  receive the plasmids?</strong> <br>
          A. We usually ship plasmids at  room temperature (no ice) as freshly-prepared bacterial glycerol stocks.&nbsp;  Our years of experience have shown that plasmids are stable in that format  during shipment (streak out and/or freeze at -80 upon arrival). We occasionally  ship plasmids as purified DNA dried on Sample Matrix from BioMatrica. For  international requests, we send DNA spotted to sterile filter paper (recover by  adding TE or a similar buffer, followed by transformation). <br><br>
          <strong>Q.&nbsp; Will I need to  get a signature on an MTA?</strong> <br>
        A. For certain plasmids, yes you will need  an MTA signature. We will be sure to identify the correct MTA and send it to you electronically to be signed by the appropriate official in your technology transfer office.&nbsp; An original signed copy of the MTA should be  returned to Catherine Cormier at Harvard Institute of Proteomics, 320 Charles Street, Cambridge MA 02141.&nbsp; We will ship your plasmids  within 2 days of receipt of the signed MTA.</span></p>
        <span class="mainbodytext">More specifically, if you are: <br>
           <span class="mainbodytext">ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS: FLEXGene  clones from HIP are covered by a minimally restrictive MTA sent with clones.  Most other clones are covered by our standard MTA, which has been pre-approved  by some institutions and is based on the well-recognized Uniform Biologicals  MTA (UB-MTA). For some clones and for some institutions, however, you will have  to get a signed MTA to us before we can send the clones. In a few exceptional  cases, you will have to get a third-party MTA signed before we can send the  clone, as all or part of the clone is covered by MTAs from more than one  institution. For more information about MTAs, including information about how  to join our 'in network' group with pre-approved MTA coverage, please contact  Catherine Cormier. If you request clones and an MTA is required, the MTA will be  emailed to you as a PDF file.<br><br>
COMPANIES: Most of the HIP  FLEXGene clones are available to companies and will be covered by a minimally  restrictive MTA between HIP and your company. We will email the MTA after you  place a request. You are also welcome to get in touch to review the terms  before placing your request.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Q.  Can we make this MTA process easier?</strong> <br>
        A. YES!!!&nbsp;  We have developed an Expedited Process MTA that your institution signs  and allows all researchers at that institution to receive all plasmids from our  collection with only an electronic signature.&nbsp;   Please email us if you are interested in starting this process with your  institution.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.hip.harvard.edu/PSIMR/Depositor Agreement/DA.html">Click  here</a> for more information about MTAs</span></p>
        <p><strong class="homepageText2"><a name="deposit"></a>HOW TO DEPOSIT PLASMIDS</strong><br><br>
          <span class="mainbodytext"><strong>Q. &nbsp;How do I deposit my clones?</strong><br>
          <a href="Submission.jsp">Click here</a> or contact us at  plasmidhelp@hms.harvard.edu for more information about depositing clones in our  collection.&nbsp; The three steps to deposit  clones are</strong><br><br>
          1.&nbsp; Have your  institution sign the Depositors Agreement.&nbsp;  This agreement sets the terms by which the plasmid repository will  distribute your plasmids.&nbsp; Contact us to  see if your institution has already signed a depositor agreement.&nbsp; Otherwise we will contact your technology  transfer office to begin the process.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.hip.harvard.edu/PSIMR/Depositor%20Agreement/DA.html">Click here</a> for more information  about depositor agreements.<br><br>
          2.&nbsp; Prepare  the data describing the details about your clones.&nbsp; Because we parse the data directly into our  database, we ask that the information you send us is in a particular format.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have submission forms and templates that  should guide you in this process.&nbsp; <br><br>
          3.&nbsp; Once we  have entered your data into our database, we can accept your plasmid  samples.&nbsp; These can be sent on dry ice  either as DNA (10-15ul of at least 15ng/ul) or glycerol stocks.&nbsp; If you send glycerol stocks the bacteria MUST  BE T1/T5 phage resistant.&nbsp; Once we  receive your samples, we will make them available for purchase through PlasmID<br><br>

          <strong>Q. What types of  plasmids cannot be shared with the repository?</strong> <br>
          A. Four types of plasmids cannot  be added to the repository.&nbsp; <br><br>
          1. Plasmids that require an  unusual or specific bacterial host strain cannot be added, as we require that  all plasmids are stored here in a phage-resistant DH5-alpha-like host strain,  in order to maintain the integrity of the collection as a whole. <br>
          <br>
          2. Plasmids that are identical  to material that is commercially available cannot be added to our  collection.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          3. Plasmids that are hazardous  or legally restricted for distribution cannot be added to the repository. <br><br>
          4. Plasmids that you do not  have the right to distribute (for example, plasmids you received from another  researcher and/or made by another person and/or protected by a patent,  licensing agreement, etc.) cannot be shared with us unless permission is also  granted by any and all relevant third parties. Sometimes this extends even to  modified forms of a plasmid.&nbsp; In general, you can share plasmids that you  made or made significant modifications, but you cannot share unmodified forms  of something you got from another researcher or a company.<br><br>
          <strong>Q. How are plasmids  stored and handled after I share them?</strong> <br>
        A. When you share plasmids with  the repository, we transform them into a phage-resistant bacterial host strain,  single colony isolate, and create working and archival glycerol stocks. These  are stored in conventional -80 degree freezers (archival copies) or in the  fully automated BioBank freezer storage system, in which working samples are  stored in individually 2D barcode-labeled tubes for automated retrieval and  array in any format.&nbsp; Information about each clone is carefully curated by PhD-level  scientists and entered into the database.</span></p>

          <br>
          <strong>Q.  What's &quot;closed&quot; vs. &quot;fusion&quot; format?</strong> <br>
A. This  terminology, adopted from the Harvard Institute of Proteomics (HIP), indicates  that a stop codon is present (closed) or is absent (fusion) in a cDNA or ORF  insert. For more details about these definitions <a href="Definitions for annotating CDS sequences_v4.doc" target="_blank">click here</a>. Fusion format clones are useful for producing C-terminally tagged  versions of an ORF.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q.  Can I use restriction enzymes with human clones in pDNR-Dual?</strong> <br>
A. The human pDNR-Dual master  clones from HIP were generated using the InFusion reaction (Clontech) rather  than an RE approach and most of the RE sites in the MCS are gone after the  insert is introduced. In the resulting master clones, the <em>Hind</em>III and <em>Sal</em>I sites are present so that enzyme pair can be used to  liberate the insert -- but beware! There could be <em>Hind</em>III or <em>Sal</em>I  sites in the insert. See more on the flexibility of using the recombinational  cloning approach rather than REs below.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q.  What is the difference between a &quot;discrepancy&quot; and a  &quot;mutation&quot;? </strong> <br>
A. 'Discrepancy' is a term  borrowed from HIP that refers to differences between the actual clone sequence  and the target sequence (that is, what the researchers were trying to clone in  a specific cloning effort). Discrepancies can result when the clone recovered  is an isoform or naturally occurring polymorphic form of the target sequence, or  from PCR, replication, or other errors. Be sure to check the insert sequence to  be sure that discrepancies that were deemed 'acceptable' to HIP researchers are  also acceptable to you. <br>
'Mutations' we define as changes  that are known or expected to affect function. We curate an insert as  containing a mutation when the insert sequence is a known mutant form (e.g.  cloned from a mutant allele) or when the clone was engineered to have a  mutation (e.g. in a site-specific mutagenesis effort). Please be aware that  there may OR MAY NOT be experimental evidence to support the idea that a  particular naturally occurring or engineered mutation results in a  constitutively active, inactive, etc. form. And be further cautioned ...  neither 'discrepancy' nor 'mutation' is the last word on nucleotide differences  between your actual clone and the wild-type form(s). Tags can come from vectors  and not be annotated as part of the insert; mutations and deletions may not be  clearly annotated or detected by those who shared clones; and recombination or  replication errors can change clones over time. DNA sequencing provides an  inexpensive and robust means to ask if the clone you received is indeed the  clone you requested and that it meets your expectations. Please perform  diagnostic tests before investing a lot of time in your experiments!<br>
<br>
<strong>Q.  What's with recombinational cloning (pDNR-Dual, pDONR201, pDONR221, etc. vectors)?</strong> <br>
A. Most clones generated at HIP  and shared with the repository are based on successful recombinational cloning  methodologies such as the Clontech Creator system (LoxP sites) or the Invitrogen  Gateway system (att sties). You can learn more about these approaches at  vendors' websites and at the HIP website http://www.hip.harvard.edu (look for  information about FLEXGene clones). These flexible systems allow a single  sequence-verified ORF (&quot;master&quot; or &quot;donor&quot; clone) to be  used to create expression constructs for a variety of different techniques via  recombination (few steps) rather than restriction enzyme cloning and ligation  (several steps). In general, we keep the master clones in our collection  because they give the most flexibility to the largest set of users. But in some  cases, we also have expression versions. &quot;Entry&quot; or  &quot;acceptor&quot; vectors used in combination with master clones to create  expression constructs are available from a number of different sources,  including Clontech and Invitrogen. Please visit their websites to learn more.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q.  Do HIP cDNA/ORF clones have 5' or 3' UTRs?</strong> <br>
A. No. The majority of HIP clone  collections (including human, yeast, and more) come from projects in which only  the open reading frames (ORFs) were cloned.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q.  Can I get help identifying a large sub-group of clones bioinformatically?</strong> <br>
A. Yes. Bioinformaticists at our  host institution, HIP, may be willing to collaborate with you to identify  specific sub-groups of clones that share some property (biochemical function,  sub-cellular localization, up-regulated in a tissue tested by microarray,  etc.). Please contact us to initiate this kind of collaborative  bioinformatics-based work with bioinformaticists at HIP. Requests are reviewed  and accepted on a case-by-case basis. Please note that we make some  bioinformatically organized groups of clones available for view and request on  the &quot;clone collections&quot; page (for example, human kinase collections  and the BC1000 genes associated with breast cancer). <br>
<br>
<strong>Q.  Who should I cite if my work with a clone requested via PlasmID results in  publication?</strong><br>
<strong>A. </strong>The people who put in the hard work to  make the clone and any appropriate references should be cited! You should be  able to find this information on the clone detail page (click on the CloneID to  get there). Look for clone authors and PubMed IDs (vectors can also have  associated authors and PubMed IDs).</p>

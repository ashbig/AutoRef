      genomic fragment insert, no insert).</td>

      to the clone (Yeast, Pseudomonas, others).</td>

      database.</td>

    <td class="controlpaneltext">Reference Sequence</td>
    <td class="mainbodytext">Sequence that the insert was INTENDED to be (for 
      example, target sequence in a large-scale ORF cloning project). Not necessarily 
      an exact match or same limits as the actual insert.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="controlpaneltext">MUTATION</td>
    <td class="mainbodytext">Is not necessarily the final word on differences 
      between your clone and a reference sequence! We use &quot;mutation&quot; 
      to show clones that were made from a mutant allele or were intentionally 
      engineered to have a mutation (for example, a change introduced to create 
      a dominant negative form of a gene). Other differences can be present: see 
      &quot;DISCREPANCIES&quot; and &quot;FORMAT&quot; (fusion v. closed) and 
      make note that a tag/fusion protein ORF (such as GST, EGFP or Myc) might 
      be a feature of the INSERT or of the VECTOR. Check both to be sure you have 
      learned all you can about the clone!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="controlpaneltext">DISCREPANCY</td>
    <td class="mainbodytext">Is language adopted from the Harvard Institute of 
      Proteomics that alerts you to nucleotide differences between the reference 
      sequence (the sequence the researcher(s) intended to clone) and the actual 
      clone. Discrepancies may be silent or conserved substitutions, naturally 
      occurring polymorphisms, splice variants, PCR-introduced errors, small deletions, 
      or other difference that creates a difference between the actual clone and 
      the reference sequence. Click on the clone sequence in the clone page and 
      then do a conceptual translation or BLAST search to see if the clone is 
      acceptable for your needs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="41" class="controlpaneltext">INSERT FORMAT</td>
    <td class="mainbodytext">Is language adopted from the Harvard Institute of 
      Proteomics and distinguishes cDNA/ORFs in which the natural stop codon is 
      present (CLOSED) from those in which the natural stop codon was purposely 
      changed in order to create/allow C-terminal fusions (FUSION). For clones 
      in recombinational vectors, the 'acceptor' or 'expression' vector you choose 
      will determine what C-terminal fusion is made.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="controlpaneltext">VECTOR</td>
    <td class="mainbodytext"> Internal link to information about the vector, including 
      features, properties, PDF file of map and text of sequence (when available), 
      references, and more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="controlpaneltext">SELECTION MARKERS</td>
    <td class="mainbodytext">Resistance genes or similar present in the clone 
      for selection (note that selection is listed for a particular host cell/organism).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="controlpaneltext">DISTRIBUTION</td>
    <td class="mainbodytext">Information on any limits to distribution on the 
      clone. The majority of clones are limited to academic and non-profit labs 
      but additional restrictions and/or special treatment (see below) may apply.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="controlpaneltext">SPECIAL TREATMENT</td>
    <td class="mainbodytext">Information on additional MTAs required for specific 
      clones (for example, a CRE-specific MTA for CRE-containing clones). </td>

  <tr> 
    <td class="controlpaneltext">IS VERIFIED and VERIFICATION METHOD</td>
    <td class="mainbodytext">&quot;Is verified&quot; indicates whether or note 
      the DONOR lab verified the insert/clone by some method (for example, by 
      sequencing the insert or restriction enzyme digestion and analysis of fragments) 
      and &quot;verification method&quot; tells you what method was used. This 
      does NOT mean that we confirmed this information by any method. As is always 
      the case, it's best to confirm the identity of the plasmid by some appropriate 
      method before you use the clone. We welcome your feedback -- if you find 
      a clone isn't what you thought it was, please let us know as soon as possible.</td>

  <tr>

      (optional) = clone.</td>

  <tr> 
    <td class="controlpaneltext">VECTOR</td>
    <td class="mainbodytext">The vector used in the construct. Only when we list 
      the vector as a CLONE do we actually have the empty vector in our collection.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="controlpaneltext">cDNA</td>
    <td class="mainbodytext">Partial or full-length cDNA inserts cloned directly 
      or via PCR from a cDNA template. Please note that human clones from HIP 
      were cloned from cDNA so they're listed as such but they contain only the 
      open reading frame (no 5' or 3' UTR). Other cDNA clones in the collection 
      may or may not have partial or complete UTRs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="controlpaneltext">ORF</td>
    <td class="mainbodytext"> cDNA-like fragment that was cloned based on annotation 
      of ORFs on a particular genome (for example, all of the predicted ORFs from 
      Pseudomonas were cloned by the Harvard Institute of Proteomics -- not cDNAs 
      -- and thus, the ORF clones may not be the same as what you'd get with a 
      collection based on cDNAs).</td>

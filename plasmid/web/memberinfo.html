<strong>What does it mean to be a member of the Expedited MTA Network? </strong> 
<p>Your institution has already agreed to the terms of our material transfer agreement 
  (MTA) in advance of your plasmid order. This means that when you order your 
  plasmids, we will begin processing your order without the delay of negotiating 
  the MTA with your technology transfer office. When you check out, you will be 
  asked to personally agree to the terms of the MTA.</p>
<p>There are some plasmids in our collection with special MTAs that are not covered 
  for member institutions. For these plasmid orders, we will send you the MTA 
  package and work with your technology transfer office to have them signed as 
  quickly as possible (usually these special MTAs are signed within a week).</p>
<p>If your institution is not a member, please contact us at 
    <a href="mailto:plasmidMTA@hms.harvard.edu">plasmidMTA@hms.harvard.edu</a> 
  so you too can begin receiving your plasmids without delay.<br>

We can arrange the clones in any order you specify for a plate. Please provide us a file
to specify how you want the clones to be arranged on the 96 well plate. The file has three columns separated by comma (","). The first column
is either PlasmID Clone ID (HsCD00001234) or FLEXGene Clone ID (FLH000123.01X). The second column is a plate name. The third column
is a well number for 96 well plate (A1 - H12). Please note that we don't allow duplicate clones in the same file. 
Clones on the same plate must have the same growth condition.

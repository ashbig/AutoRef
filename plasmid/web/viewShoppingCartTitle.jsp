There are two options for covering the cost of shipment.  (1) Include a FedEx account number at check-out. (2) If you don't provide a FedEx account number, we will add a standard shipping charge at check-out ($10.00 for domestic; $15.00 for international).<br>

There are two options for paying for your request.  (1) Include a purchase order (PO) number at check-out.  (2) During check-out, use a credit card through PayPal (you do not need to register with PayPal to use a credit card).<br>

You can save your cart and return to check-out another time (remember to sign in to see your saved cart).

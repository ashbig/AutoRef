		<p><b><bean:message key="flex.name"/></b> (Full-Length Expression) will be a complete repository of full-length cDNA clones for the human and other model organisms.  The fundamental goal of this repository is to enable high-throughput protein expression.  To this end, the clones are all constructed using a recombination-based vector system so that hundreds or thousands of coding regions can be simultaneously transferred into any protein expression vector overnight.  These transfers can be made mutation free into virtually any kind of expression vector allowing the broadest variety of experiments.</p>
		<p>Because most high-throughput approaches will require the addition of peptide tags, a crucial feature of the cloning strategy is to remove the untranslated regions of each cDNA to allow the production of fusion proteins on either or both ends of the protein if desired.  This repository of "expression-ready" clones is an important next step after the completion of the genome, and one that has the potential to revolutionize the study of protein function by enabling the high-throughput production and analysis of proteins.  </P>
		
		<h3>Database</h3>
		<p>The database that tracks this repository can be viewed here.  It contains one representative of each full-length sequenced cDNA listed in UniGene.  Each gene is listed with two ID numbers.  </p>
		<p><b>HIP_SID</b> is our local ID number that is permanently linked to the specific cDNA sequence used to capture a gene.  Clicking on this number will provide specific information about each gene as well as any clones that been produced for it.</p>
		<p><b>GenBank Accession</b> is the corresponding GenBank Accession number used for the gene.  Clicking on this number will link to the GenBank entry for this sequence.</p>

		<h3>Searching the database</h3>
		<p>There are three ways to search the database:</p>
		<UL>
			<li><b>View All Genes</b> ? this is a comprehensive list of all genes in the database in the order by which they were added to the database.</li>
			<li><b>View All Cloned Genes</b> ? this is a list of all genes that have been physically captured into plasmids.  They have not necessarily been sequence-verified.</li>
			<li><b>Search FLEX Database</b> ? this is a way to search for genes that meet specific criteria.  Users can look for all genes that have ?cyclin? in the gene or ?cdk? in the gene symbol.   Users can also use Boolean logic.</li>
		</ul>

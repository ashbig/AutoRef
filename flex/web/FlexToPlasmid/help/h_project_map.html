    # comment - line starts with '#'
    # map is case sensitive!!!!
# this map is to cover followinfg cases:

# 0)property B of object A in FLEXDB is not mapped at all to any object 
# in  PLASMIDDB.  

# 1)property B of object A in FLEXDB is called differently than 
# property B of object A in PLASMIDDB. Remapping of property names
# implemented by using FLEX_PLASMID_DEFINITION_MAP

# 2)property B of object A in FLEXDB is called differently and not
# fully described compare to property B of object A in PLASMIDDB. Remapping of property names
# implemented by using FLEX_PLASMID_DEFINITION_MAP with missing value stored in 
# column "value1"
# example: clone file, property 'clonetype' is associated with species, not technicaly,but...
# CONNECT_PLASMID_FLEX_SPECIES_SUBMITTED	-1	Homo sapiens	-1	Homo sapiens	cDNA	NULL

# 3)property B of object A in FLEXDB is 
# a property C of the object D in PLASMID.
# so, we need complete remapping  of property 
# example: PDB ID of FlexSequence in FLEXDB become PBD ID of clone (CLONENAME file)
# property name in FLEX: 'P_ID', property name in PLASMID='PDB ID'

# 4) in addition to 3, existance of property C of object D can
# triger addition of several more properties.

# 3 & 4 are batch specific and cannot be hardcoded:(

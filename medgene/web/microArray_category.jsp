Using the MedGene database, we can put a disease related gene list into four different categories.
<br>1. First-degree associations:  genes that have been directly linked to this disease by gene term search
<br>2. First-degree associations by family term:  genes that have been directly linked to this disease by family term search
<br>3. Second degree associations:  genes that have never been co-cited with this disease, but have been linked to at least one first-degree gene
<br>4.Genes new to this disease: genes that have not been previously associated with this disease.

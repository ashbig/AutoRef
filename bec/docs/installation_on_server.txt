BEC installation on the server

1.	setup SERVER where BEC will be installed 
	a.	server setup include as for FLEX and MEDGENE the following
		i.	Apache-Tomcat server (ver 4.0)
		ii.	JDK 1.4.0_03
		iii.	Connection to BEC repository
		iv.	WinCVS
		v.	reconfigure build.xml script to run on server settings
	b.	setup of the following programs (see Appendix below): 
		i.	needle, 
		ii.	blast  
		iii.	phred,
		iv.	phred/conseq/phrap package/
		v.	primer3
	c. setup transfer of blastable databases from kotel

2.	create output directories mentioned in code(see Appendix below):
	a.	needle alignment 				/needleoutput/
	b.	needle alignment for assembly		/tmp_assembly/
	c.	blast output					/blastouput/
	d.	trace files damp				/trace_file_damp/ 
	e.	trace files 

3.	create and setup overnight scripts to be run on output directories delete .in files (see Appendix)
4.	create and setup scripts to create blastable db
5.	cleanup BEC repository directory (done)
6.	decide on location of production db for BEC
7.	create DB schema for this db.
8.	insert required information into database



Appendix
	setup of the following programs 	(see below where to put exe)
		a.	needle (Emboss-2.5.1 : http://www.cbi.pku.edu.cn/tools/EMBOSS/download.html)
			i.	compile
			ii.	test 
			iii.	set link to the exe in code
	b.	blast 
			i.	compile latest version (current run on kotel has a bug)
			ii.	test
			iii.	set link in code to blastable databases 
			iv.	set link in code to blast exe
	c.	phred/conseq/phrap (vector file – link to proper file for vector trimming)
			i.	compile
			ii.	set vector file
			iii.	test
			iv.	set link to exe and vector file
	d.	primer3 (there is a win version in bec/lib) 
			i.	compile
			ii.	put settings file in the same directory
			iii.	test
			iv.	set settings file (thr classpath)
			v.	set link to exe and settings file

create output directories mentioned in code as well program m directories:
	1.	needle alignment 				/needleoutput/
	2.	needle alignment for assembly		/tmp_assembly/
	3.	blast output					/blastouput/
	4.	trace files damp				/trace_file_damp/ 
	5.	trace files distribution root directory		/trace_files_root

	6.	for programs:
		a.	create programs directory
		b.	create subdir per program
			/bioprograms/
			/ bioprograms/blast/
			/ bioprograms/primer3/ exe + setting file
			/ bioprograms/emboss-2.5.1/…./
			/ bioprograms/phredphrap/all exe and phredPhrap script 
			/ bioprograms/phredphrap/lib/vector file

7. create dir for blastable 	db transferred from kotel		

7.	!!!!!   reconfigure file copy based on remote/same machine location of the last two directories


Code configuration
	Use Unix (?) not Win OS

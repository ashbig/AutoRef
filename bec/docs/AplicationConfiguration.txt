Application configuration:


Application is configured by three variables
defined in 
            package edu.harvard.med.hip.utility
            class   ApplicationHostDeclaration
 a. IS_BIGHEAD sets all class passes to third party programs and 
server directories according to OS of the server;
 b. IS_BIGHEAD_FOR_EXPRESSION_EVALUATION sets all if blocks inside java 
code for DIFFERENT versions of ACE package code ;
 c.  JSP_REDIRECTION sets jsp redirection for each version of application;


should ACE package run on more than two possible server machines, variables 
IS_BIGHEAD  and IS_BIGHEAD_FOR_EXPRESSION_EVALUATION
                a. renamed to SERVER_MACHINE
                b. get type int
                c. all server machines should get own value






1.	To configure new application for the same server:
            
            set JSP_REDIRECTION and IS_BIGHEAD_FOR_EXPRESSION_EVALUATION;




2.	To reconfigure from one server machine to another (make sure your setting are according to OS)
            set IS_BIGHEAD;

a. build the following directories (min set)

            - trace_files_damp
            - trace_files_root
            - output
                - blast_output
                - needle_output
                - tmp_needle_output
                - tmp
b. setup scheduled jobs
    i. clean up jobs
    ii. transfer of blastable databases from FLEX server


c. install and setup cygwin for Win machine
d. rebuild all third party programs and setup them
                1. EMBOSS package
                2. primer3 (can be transferred as .exe on WIn)
                3. assembly package
                4. blast
e. set phredPhrap script according to machine settings

f. set values of program/directory passes in the following java files


file :  edu.harvard.med.hip.bec.Constants.getTemporaryFilesPath()
file:       TraceFileProcessingRunner
file:       PhredWrapper
file:       EndReadsWrapperRunner
file:       PhredPhrap
file:       PolymorphismDetector
file:       NeedleWrapper
file:       BlastWrapper
file:       FileOperations
file:       Contig
file:       DiscrepancyFinder
file:       Primer3Wrapper
file:       Constants
file:       OutstandingJobs 


3.	To reconfigure from Win to Unix 
            a.	Verify all steps in 2.
            b.	change and recompile trimming_java_script.java, put
 trimming_java_script$classes into phredPhrap directory
            
            d. change following java file that manipulate file passes

package edu.harvard.med.hip.bec.programs.phred;
class   PhredPhap
class   PhredWrapper

package edu.harvard.med.hip.bec.programs.needle;
class    NeedleWrapper

recompile trimming script and configure phrepPhap to run it

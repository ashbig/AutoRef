1. Datatabse tables set by admin:

nametype;
sampletype  (ISOLATE, CONTROL requered) ;
processdefinition;
SPECIESDEFINITION;
PROJECTDEFINITION;


linker;
vector;
vectorprimer;
commonprimer;
vectorfeature;


2. Flexinfo table:
flexcloneid, flexsequenceid  - requered;



3. Input data

- refernce sequence submission ( refsequence, sequenceinfo, name );

The sequence file contains  one record per sequence. 
Each record MUST contain following fields separated by tab
:
- sequence id (required).The sequence id is the unique identifier for each sequence. 
- species (required), 
- CDS start (required), 
- CDS stop (required),
- GC content (optional),
- cDNA source (optional),
- chromosome (optional),
- sequence text (required). 


The name file contains reference information for the sequence. It can have from 0 to N records per sequence:
 - sequence id, 
 - name type ,
 - name value ,
 - name url ;
 - description. 
The sequence id is the same id used in the sequence file. 
The name type field must be valid name types in the database.





- clone collection mapping information (containerheader, sample, flexinfo );
 !!!! changes to be done to go from 96 samples per collection into n !!!!

- unique collection name (required), 
- user collection id (optional),
- collection type (optional);

-- per each clone in collection:

- user unique clone  id ( requered);
- user unique refsequence id ( requered) (same as in sequencing file that used for refsequence 
submission, or sequence information should  submited into database);
- user unique construct id ( requered) : construct allows connect several clones to the same rference sequence and
define their relative quality. 
- clone position in collection ( requered) (counter , starts from 1);
- user sampleid for clone (optional)

<p><strong>Storage of trace file information.</strong></p>
<p> Decoding trace file names from sequencing facility. Sequence trace file names 
  usually contain plate name, well and read direction in various configurations. 
  The user describes the location of each of these items separately by specifying 
  the separator, section number, offset inside each section, and the length. The 
  separator is a string (often a single character such as the underscore in this 
  example) that may be repeated in the name, breaking it into several 'sections'. 
  The section number identifies the part that contains desired item; offset from 
  the beginning of the section and length allow ACE to extract the item. If the 
  sequencing facility applies its own name to the plate, it MUST provides a lookup 
  table indicating the correspondence between the users’ and the sequencing facility’s 
  plate names. </p>

<p><strong>Block diagram of Decision Tool</strong></p>
<p>

This figure illustrates the logic used by the Decision Tool to assign clones to their various action groups indicated by the colored blocks.  The tool will process any clones in the system.  However, as the definition of clone quality is based upon comparing the list of discrepancies for the clone with the users’ specifications for discrepancies, sorting clones to certain sub-groups requires a previous run through the Discrepancy Finder.  Each action group is a separate tab-delimited list of clones that can be used to initiate the corresponding process.

<p>
Clone reads deemed to be of sufficient quality are supplemented by a pseudo read generated from the reference sequence with all bases set to a confidence score of 19 and submitted to the Phrap assembly process. The alignment matrix of clone reads is retrieved from Phrap output in order to determine the positions of each read relative to the reference sequence.  Consensus sequences and confidence scores are computed for the various contigs using a naïve Bayes classifier, and the results are reported. The calculated contigs are trimmed to drop low confidence tails.

<p><strong>Gap Mapper contig calculation</strong></p>
<p> Clone reads deemed to be of sufficient quality are supplemented by a pseudo 
  read generated from the reference sequence with all bases set to a confidence 
  score of 19 and submitted to the Phrap assembly process. The alignment matrix 
  of clone reads is retrieved from the Phrap output in order to determine the 
  positions of each read relative to the reference sequence. Consensus sequences 
  and confidence scores are computed for the various contigs using a naïve Bayes 
  classifier, and the results are reported. The calculated contigs are trimmed 
  to drop low confidence tails. </p>

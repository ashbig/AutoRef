<p><strong> Block diagram of typical clone sequence verification workflow.</strong></p>
<p>The diagram illustrates a typical workflow for the full length sequence validation 
  of a protein coding clone. The process, which is described in detail in the 
  text, is an iterative process that collects sequence reads, assembles contigs, 
  finds gaps in coverage, finds regions of low confidence, compares the contig 
  sequence with the expected sequence, and determines the overall acceptability 
  of the clone. Processing steps in parentheses and italics are optional. </p>

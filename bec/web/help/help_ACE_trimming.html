<strong><font color="#0099CC"><div align='center'>ACE trimming for the scored sequence</div></font></strong> 

<p><strong><font color="#0099CC">When executed:</font></strong> </p>
<p>ACE trims scored sequence for quality: 
<ul><li>1. Quality check for end reads (low   quality always rejected by application); </li>
  <li>2. Sequence assembly: when quality trimming is requested (user request, 
    rerunable); </li>
 <li> 3. Trace files quality report ( no action   taken); </li>
  <li>4. Gap mapper & Low confidence finder Algorithms applied for trimming: </li>
  </ul>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>End reads quality check: </strong>
<ul><li>high quality read length, as defined by phred alt   trimming (see Phred documentation), should be over 120 bases;
</li><li>it should be   over 100 bases of good quality (phred score >= 20) in the first 300 bases of   read.
</li></ul>  
<p>All parameters for this algorithms are hardcoded in ACE. </p>
<p><strong>Sequence assembly:</strong> 
<ul> <li>trace is first checked to pass quality criteria (see   algorithm for trace files quality report);</li>
   <li>if trace pass quality check, it 
  is trimmed by applying Phred alt trim algorithm. </li>
 </ul> 
  
  <strong> Trace files quality report: </strong>
  

  <ul><li>trace should have at least N bases long; </li>
  average score for all bases between 
 <li> base X and base Y should be over than score Z, Ambiquous bases are excluded.</li> </ul>
  
<p>Parameters N, X, Y, and Z are defined on application level in ApplicationSettings.property 
  file. </p>

     Start of Delete section
    Create a copy of this file as text file (extension .txt).
    
    Delete "delete section" from your file: header MUST be first line of the file.
    You can append information for the new linker(s) to the existing file.
    No duplicates will be submitted: two linkers are considered to 
    be duplicates if they have the same (case sensitive) name OR sequence.
    Please be aware that '3p NIH_MGC' and '3p      NIH_MGC' will be considered as 
    two different liners: number of white spaces inside name is important.
